Managing a local playlist: users have ability to add all songs to a local playlist that are available in the app,  
but only have access to downloaded songs without a network connection. Requires a created account, a search function 
to find specific songs, and a folder creation for when a playlist is created. Users then can download songs in the 
created playlist so that it is available on their device without a connection, 
which requires storage and caching.
